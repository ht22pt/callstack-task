# callstack.io task

The problem is available in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/mnmtanish/478ca89c5c483b6df079d29aadc50221). There are 2 apps in this repository. The **server** is a mock data server which serves data using a GraphQL API from memory. The **client** application displays data from the server.

```

The demo will be available in http://localhost:3000
